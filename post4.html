    <p>I really liked the feedback I got. It was clear and helpful, which made it easy for me to understand what I was
      doing well and where I could improve. The supportive tone also made me feel motivated to keep working on my
      skills.

  <p><i>“Hi Amanda, Welcome and thank you for completing the Who am I questionnaire. I’ve been reviewing your answers
      and
      I
      noticed that you are a bit worried about the language barrier. I think it’s wise to make yourself feel welcome to
      us
      teachers and your fellow students as soon as possible. It will make it easier to ask for clarity or extra
      explanation in my opinion. It’s good to know that we offer lots of opportunities to ask questions and things like
      that and my experience is that, when one feels uncertain about your communication, chances are that one starts
      avoiding to ask questions. So, just come to school, make friends and ask questions.

      I hope this answers your questions. If there is anything else I can help you with, feel free to ask.
      <p>Kind regards, Daan de Waard”</p>
