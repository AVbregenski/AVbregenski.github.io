    <h2>Study choice</h2>
    <p>I’ve chosen to study Information Technology (IT) because I’m fascinated by technology and enjoy exploring how it
        works. The strong job prospects, competitive salaries, and job security in IT make it a smart career choice. I
        love problem-solving, and IT offers plenty of challenges in this area. The flexibility of remote work is
        appealing, and the creative aspects, like user experience (UX) design, allow me to combine tech skills with
        creative thinking. Additionally, IT’s constant evolution keeps things interesting, and I appreciate the chance
        to work collaboratively. Lastly, IT provides a solid foundation for my entrepreneurial ambitions. Overall, IT
        aligns perfectly with my interests and career goals.</p>
