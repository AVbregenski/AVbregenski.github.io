  <h2>Programming experience</h2>
  <div class="post">
    <p>Although I have almost no experience in programming, I found the learning process surprisingly straightforward.
      The concepts and logic behind coding started to make sense to me relatively quickly, and I was able to grasp the
      basics with ease. This initial understanding was encouraging and made me more confident in exploring programming
      further.
      Additionally, I was fortunate to have supportive colleagues who guided me through the more challenging aspects of
      programming. Their help was invaluable in clarifying complex topics and providing practical insights. With their
      support, I was able to overcome obstacles and build a solid foundation in programming, which has been instrumental
      in my progress and continued learning.
