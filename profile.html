  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <img id="eu" src="photo2/me.jpg" alt="1" width="300px" height="auto">
  <div class="profiletext" class="quarter">
    <p>Nice to meet you! I’m Amanda Bregenski, a 19-year-old Brazilian currently living in the Netherlands. Since 2022,
      I've been calling this beautiful country my home. I've been working in the horeca sector at a restaurant in Goes,
      where I've gained valuable experience and enjoyed interacting with people from various backgrounds.
      One of my favorite things to do here is to explore the local culture and cuisine. I love going out with friends
      and discovering new places, whether it’s a cozy café or a picturesque town. Traveling around the Netherlands has
      been a
      fantastic experience; each city and village has its own unique charm.

      I’m also passionate about learning Dutch. The language is both fascinating and challenging, but I'm making great
      progress. Immersing myself in the language has made my experience here even more rewarding, and I enjoy practicing
      Dutch in my daily interactions.

      Living in the Netherlands has broadened my horizons and given me a new perspective on life. I’m excited to
      continue
      exploring, learning, and making the most of my time here.</p>

  <h2>Movie:</h2>

  <div class="movieText">
    <p>My all-time favorite movie is Kick-Ass, and I can't help but be enthusiastic about it. The film masterfully
      blends comedy with action while weaving in a poignant and sometimes tragic story. It follows Dave Lizewski, an
      ordinary teenager who decides to become a real-life superhero, despite lacking any special abilities or training.

      What ensues is a thrilling adventure filled with humorous moments, intense action sequences, and a deeper
      exploration of the consequences and personal sacrifices involved in living a double life as a hero.</p>
